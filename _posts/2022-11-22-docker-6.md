## Problem
항상 잘되던 docker build 가 어느날 오류가 발생했다.

```yaml
FROM node:16

RUN apt-get update || : && apt-get install python -y
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk  
```
{: file='Dockerfile'}

```sh
$ docker-compose build --no-cache

## Solution
docker 에 할당된 사용량이 초과되었으므로 용량 정리를 해준 후 build 한다.
```console
$ docker image prune -f
$ docker container prune -f
```
